Advanced DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript, NOT RESPONSIVE, ONLY DESKTOP MODE

> A modern, interactive, and visually appealing banking UI project inspired by minimalist design principles.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic and accessible layout  
- **CSS3** – Custom styles with variables, gradients, and transitions  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – DOM manipulation, events, tabbed components, sliders, modals  
- **Intersection Observer API** – Lazy loading images and reveal-on-scroll effects  
- **Responsive & Interactive UI** – Sticky nav, modal windows, smooth scroll, slider

## 👀 Why This Project Stands Out

- Sleek, minimalist banking interface  
- Fully interactive elements: modal windows, tabbed operations, sliders  
- Smooth scrolling, sticky navigation, and lazy-loading images for performance  
- Clean design using custom CSS and Google Fonts (Poppins)  
- Demonstrates ability to follow tutorials and implement complex frontend functionality
