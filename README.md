## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic and accessible layout  
- **CSS3** – Custom styles with variables, gradients, and transitions  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – DOM manipulation, events, tabbed components, sliders, modals  
- **Intersection Observer API** – Lazy loading images and reveal-on-scroll effects  
- **Responsive & Interactive UI** – Sticky nav, modal windows, smooth scroll, slider

## 👀 Why This Project Stands Out

- Sleek, minimalist banking interface  
- Fully interactive elements: modal windows, tabbed operations, sliders  
- Smooth scrolling, sticky navigation, and lazy-loading images for performance  
- Clean design using custom CSS and Google Fonts (Poppins)  
- Demonstrates ability to follow tutorials and implement complex frontend functionality

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Advanced DOM manipulation and event delegation  
- Implementing **lazy loading** and **Intersection Observer API**  
- Smooth scroll and sticky navigation implementation  
- Slider functionality with dots navigation  
- Translating tutorial knowledge into a polished, interactive frontend project  

> 📌 *This project was built by following Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript Course, which helped me understand modern frontend patterns, UI interactivity, and user experience enhancements.*
